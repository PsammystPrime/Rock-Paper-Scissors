# ROCK-Paper-Scissors
 This is a game that is common.
 It's designed purely using javascript with the full intent of testing one's understanding of the language.
 You can fully play it from the console-at the moment.
 To get to the console;
 open your computer browser,
 click on the three dots of the side pannel,
 navigate to more tools and eventually to the developer tools.
 Have fun.
