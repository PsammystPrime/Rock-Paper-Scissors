###
This is a game initially created to run on the console but progressively, on a ui.  
The rules are as follows:  
1. Rock beats Scissors; This is because a rock can break a pair of scissors and not vice-versa.  
2. Scissors beat Paper; This is because a pair of scissors can cut a piece of paper.  
3. Paper beats Rock; This is so because working smart beats working hard.

###
It's designed using HTML, CSS & JavaScript with the full intent of testing one's ability to solve challenges.


 **Have fun**
